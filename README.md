As part of my assignment with HTML and CSS I created a static webpage that gives a brief intro/bio about me. I included lists of foods I like to eat and a small list of hobbies and interests.


Peer Review by; Brandon Le - I thought his website was really really cool the design for the background and how everything was sectioned off was really nice and I liked the color scheme. Also he did a good job with the information provided I liked how he told us his favorite orders from his favorite food places also. Really good job. Needs to add the git ignore file and he said he would. It has linkedin and github links and everything looks nice! I wish my website looked as nice as Pedros.
